  <h1>American USD to Foreign Currency</h1>

  <div class="info-content">
    <h2>What Makes a Currency <span class="strong-country">Strong</span> or <span class="weak-country">Weak</span>?</h2>
    <p>A currency is classified as strong when it is worth more than another country’s currency – in other words, if the American dollar was worth half a pound, the pound would be considerably stronger than the dollar. This also means that the American dollar would be considerably weaker than the pound. As a result, it would be easier for someone from England to afford a vacation in America than it would be for someone from America to afford a vacation in England. It also means that products from England would cost more for an American, and products from America would cost less in England. This is good to know as it's better to travel to countries where the US dollar is stronger relative to the currency of the country that you're traveling to.</p> 
    <p><strong>Stronger Dollar = More Purchasing Power!</strong></p>
