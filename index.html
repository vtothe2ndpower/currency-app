    <h2>What Makes a Currency <span class="strong-country">Strong</span> or <span class="weak-country">Weak</span>?</h2>
    <p>A currency is classified as strong when it is worth more than another country’s currency – in other words, if the American dollar was worth half a pound, the pound would be considerably stronger than the dollar. That means that the American dollar would be considerably weaker than the pound.</p>
    
    <p>It also means that it would be easier for someone from England to afford a vacation in America than it would be for someone from America to afford a vacation in England. It also means that products from England would cost more for an American, and products from America would cost less in England</p>
    <p>Travel where the dollar is strong relative to the country you're traveling to => MORE PURCHAING POWER!</p>
