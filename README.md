# Currency Converter Application

## The purpose of this project is to practice building something of practical utility with plain vanilla JavaScript (ES6+). Users can see how the the US dollar stacks up against the currencies of the other countries of the world in real-time.

### Key Takeaways
- Application is integrating 2 different API's
*(One for country data and another for currency conversion data)*
- Dataset is being sorted, filtered, and shown/hidden all with plain JavaScript
*(No reliance on a front-end library or framework)*
- Dataset is manipulated to meet my needs - its original existing properties are used to calculate additional properties
- Follows Good Coding Practices
*(Organization of code structure, error handling, and commenting throughout code)*
